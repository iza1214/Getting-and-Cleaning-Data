Overview:

The purpose of this project is to understand how to take two datasets and transform these into a tidy dataset for data analysis.
The files used in this project are around wearable computing and a full detail of the datasets are found here:

Project Summary

The project requires the following steps to be completed.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. The last step involves creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity 
and each subject.

Additional Information

Additional information on the variables, data and transformations are found in the CodeBook.MD file.
